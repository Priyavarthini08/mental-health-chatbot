# mental-health-chatbot
Mental health issues are widespread in countries all over the world. However, there is a
global shortage of human resources to provide mental health services. Untreated mental
disorders may lead to an increase in suicide attempts and mortality.

To address this problem I have created WEtalk, a mobile application with an integrated chatbot that
implements methods from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to support mentally ill
people in regulating emotions and dealing with depression and anxiety.

Its an user-friendly chatbot to increase the accessibility of
mental health support, allowing individuals to seek assistance conveniently
and provide instant responses to user queries, ensuring timely support for
individuals experiencing emotional distress or seeking guidance.

# Dataset Description
This Dataset contains basic conversations, mental health FAQs,
classical therapy conversations, Doctors' contact details and general
advice provided to people suffering from anxiety and depression.

This dataset contains intents. An “intent” is the intention behind a
user's message. For instance, If I were to say “I am sad” to the chatbot, the
intent, in this case, would be “sad”. Depending upon the intent, there is a
set of Patterns and Responses appropriate for the intent.

# Result 
This chatbot can revolutionize healthcare with its minimal human interaction. It works
on the principle of AI. The communication between the user and the system is text-based. 
The data is stored in the database and it is retrieved as and when required.
Since this chatbot is available 24*7, medications can be provided in case of an
emergency or an unfavourable situation. It is a reliable source of medical information.

# Future Work
The future scope of the project could be an AI-based healthcare chatbot integrated
with wearable devices that could monitor various biometric data, such as heart
rate, sleep patterns and activity levels, to provide a personalized support and
interventions. For example, if the chatbot detects increased stress levels or
disruptions in sleep, it could offer coping strategies, mindfulness exercises, or
connect the user with professional help if needed. This integration could offer
continuous support and help users better understand their mental health patterns,
ultimately leading to improved well-being.
