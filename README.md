# mental-health-chatbot
Mental health issues are widespread in countries all over the world. However, there is a
global shortage of human resources to provide mental health services. Untreated mental
disorders may lead to an increase in suicide attempts and mortality.

To address this problem I introduce introduce WEtalk, a mobile application with an integrated chatbot that
implements methods from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to support mentally ill
people in regulating emotions and dealing with depression and anxiety.

Its an user-friendly chatbot to increase the accessibility of
mental health support, allowing individuals to seek assistance conveniently
and provide instant responses to user queries, ensuring timely support for
individuals experiencing emotional distress or seeking guidance.
