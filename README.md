# mental-health-chatbot
Mental health issues are widespread in countries all over the world. However, there is a
global shortage of human resources to provide mental health services. Untreated mental
disorders may lead to an increase in suicide attempts and mortality.
To address this problem I introduce introduce WEtalk, a mobile application with an integrated chatbot that
implements methods from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to support mentally ill
people in regulating emotions and dealing with depression and anxiety.
